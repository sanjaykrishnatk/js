pillars of oops
---------------------
1)inheritance -- mechanism used to access methods and properties from other classes
    -parent class (super class/base class)
    -child  class (dericed class/sub class)
keyword - extends - classical inheritance
object inheritancce - keyword - __proto__

multilevel inheritance 
2)polymorphism 
    poly - many
    morphism - forms

    i) method / function overloading
       - method with same name but diffrent arguements
       -execute based on the number of arguements

       --rest operator(...) - it returns arguements as array.
   
   
    ii)method overriding

    --method with same name and same number of arguements
    --the last written method
    --JavaScript support this concept

3)encapsulation
4)abstraction


Exception handling
--------------------------
exception - runtime errors/an unexpected behavior (wrong or not) that occurs during software execution. This can interrupts the normal flow of execution and needs proper handling.
try-catch block
at a time one block works, either try or catch
try{
    statements that can cause error.
}catch{
    statements to handle error
}finally{
    statements that have to be executed in both case
}
